h1. Introduction
Reliability of original C64 CPU has been disputed in community for long time. Commodore had problems with it in the past, plenty of houses were put in fire because of it. Today, over 35 years after first Commodore 64 was produced another issue becomes especially painful: some of bricks decide now to ignore its spec and generate voltage that exceeds its nominal 5VDC thus frying most of precious chips.

Original PSU is not easy to replace. Commodore decided that C64 must be powered with two types of voltages: 9VAC that is then rectified and regulated by circuit located inside computer and 5VDC that is rectified and regulated by circuit iside power brick and is used *directly* to power most of C64 chips.
