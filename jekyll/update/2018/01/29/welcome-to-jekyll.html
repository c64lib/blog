        <p>You’ll find this post in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>To add new posts, simply add a file in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory that follows the convention <code class="highlighter-rouge">YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext</code> and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span><br data-jekyll-commonmark-ghpages="" />  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span><br data-jekyll-commonmark-ghpages="" /><span class="k">end</span><br data-jekyll-commonmark-ghpages="" /><span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span><br data-jekyll-commonmark-ghpages="" /><span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>
