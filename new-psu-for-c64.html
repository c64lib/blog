<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Reliability of original C64 CPU has been disputed in community for long time. Commodore had problems with it in the past, plenty of houses were put in fire because of it. Today, over 35 years after first Commodore 64 was produced another issue becomes especially painful: some of bricks decide now to ignore its spec and generate voltage that exceeds its nominal 5VDC thus frying most of precious chips.</p>

<p>Original PSU is not easy to replace. Commodore decided that C64 must be powered with two types of voltages: 9VAC that is then rectified and regulated by circuit located inside computer and 5VDC that is rectified and regulated by circuit iside power brick and is used <em>directly</em> to power most of C64 chips. This second power line is actually critical, because any deviation from pretty narrow voltage range can either cause unstable operation or damage certain chips (or even all of them). Regulation circuit located inside brick proves to do this devastating job very well. For even more exciting details just check <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Power_Supply">this</a> excellent source.</p>

<em>Various units, from left: Ismet supply (“breadbin”), Ismet supply (early C64C), Dee Van unit (C64 short board) and a brand new PSU replacement by <a href="mailto:raf@c64power.com">Rafał Szyja</a></em></p>

<p>I wouldn’t exaggerate if I say that using the same PSU for more than 30 years is like playing Russian Roulette. We definitely needs some…</p>

<h1 id="alternatives">…alternatives</h1>

<p>There are plenty of alternate solutions available, unfortunatelly most of them are DIY, and not everybody have sufficient skills for that. And if have and do something wrong, you may kill a patient. Too bad… Let’s look briefly at options that we have:</p>

<h2 id="power-savers">Power savers</h2>

<p>Power Saver is an additional overvoltage protection that is plugged between PSU and computer (can be also mounted inside the computer). I think that original idea came from <a href="http://personalpages.tds.net/~rcarlsen/cbm/c64/SAVER/">Ray Carlsen</a> as he got more and more damaged C64s due to PSU malfunction. In its simplest form this is electro-mechanical device using relay that turns off 5V DC line when some predefined threshold (i.e. 5.4V) is meet. Ray never claimed that saver is “the final and best solution” - it’s rather workaround of a problem - you can still use your PSU while waiting for new replacement. With saver and original old PSU there is still a risk, that circuit and relay will not react fast enough to save your electronics, if regulator gets badly shorted.</p>

<p>However, it still makes sense to use saver while using switching PSU replacement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After-market power supplies, even switching types, can fail at any time. Switchers are more reliable and much less prone to catastrophic failures but can still cause damage to the computer if they fail. This Saver is designed to protect any computer that uses the standard Commodore “brick” power supply as well as any newer switch-mode PS.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="replace-linear-regulator">Replace linear regulator</h2>

<p>This is pretty easy DIY fix that someone suggested in Facebook discussion: if you’re lucky enough to disassemble your original PSU, you can replace linear regulator with switching regulator such as 5V UBEC, commonly used to power electronics onboard of RC models.</p>

<em>Light colors of PSU fits well with C64C beige case</em></p>

<p>The unit is not particularily small. In fact it is bigger than any of original PSUs that are in my possesion (refer first figure). This is partially because manufacturer decides not to produce dedicated case but to use generic one that is available on the market. Most importantly, we have two power supply units here in fact, bundled in one package. Bigger case also improves cooling, which was actually a weak point of original PSU. Here in fact, I haven’t observed any noticeable heat production, which is very promising.</p>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<p>My test run started with set that should draw much current out of 5VDC line: short boarded C64C with 1541UltimateII+. For Ultimate cartridge I do not use auxiliary power supply, so PSU must provide whole power.</p>

<p>This is the combination I used most of the time. I have noticed no instabilities or other reliability problems. PSU run cool and silent.</p>

<p>Next, I have replaced 1541U with real 1541II drive. I deliberately left PSU on the desk, lying nearby floppy drive so see whether it may produce any significant interference that may influence the drive. This time I have also no problems - both C64 and 1541II run stable and PSU stayed cool.</p>

<p>I have also used this PSU with C64 (Assy 250407) and 1541 “toaster”. With this version more chips are using 9VAC line. There was apparently no difference in PSU behavior.</p>

<p>Last set I have assembled for this test was C64C with long board connected with 1541 resembling “C” model.</p>
